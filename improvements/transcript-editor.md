# TranscriptEditor Page Improvements

## Overview
The TranscriptEditor component (`omvee-ui/src/components/TranscriptEditor.tsx`) handles the unified workflow for audio upload, transcription, and lyric editing.

## Current Status: âœ… MVP Complete
The page is functional and ready for production use with core features working well.

## Potential Improvements

### ðŸ”¶ Progress Bar During Transcription
**Issue**: Progress bar stays at 0% during transcription process until completion
**Likely Cause**: Backend not sending incremental progress updates
**Impact**: Low - doesn't block functionality but reduces user confidence
**Investigation**: Check console logs during transcription, verify backend progress API
**File**: `TranscriptEditor.tsx` lines 286-291 (polling logic)

### ðŸ”¶ Boundary Clicking Edge Case
**Issue**: Clicking segment sometimes highlights previous segment instead
**Cause**: Segment boundaries overlap (segment end = next segment start)
**Current Fix**: Added 0.1s offset, but edge case still occurs occasionally
**Impact**: Low - minor UX annoyance
**Better Fix**: More sophisticated boundary detection or segment gap handling
**File**: `TranscriptEditor.tsx` lines 88-92 (currentSegmentIndex logic)

### ðŸ”¶ Debug Console Logs
**Issue**: Console.log statements still present during transcription
**Impact**: Minimal - only affects development
**Fix**: Remove debug logging added for troubleshooting
**File**: `TranscriptEditor.tsx` lines 287, 290 (progress polling)

## Future Enhancements

### ðŸš€ Audio Waveform Visualization
Add visual waveform to the scrubber for better navigation

### ðŸš€ Keyboard Shortcuts
- Spacebar: Play/pause
- Arrow keys: Seek forward/backward
- Enter: Jump to next segment

### ðŸš€ Auto-save
Save changes automatically as user edits without manual confirmation

### ðŸš€ Export Options
Export transcript in various formats (SRT, VTT, plain text)

## Notes
- Component successfully handles all project states in unified workflow
- Audio controls work properly with seek/pause functionality
- Click-to-seek interaction model is intuitive and effective
- Save functionality works with or without edits (fixed blocking issue)
