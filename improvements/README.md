# OMVEE Improvements Tracking

This folder contains markdown files documenting potential improvements, known issues, and future enhancements for each page/component in the OMVEE project.

## Purpose
- Track non-blocking issues that don't affect core functionality
- Document future enhancement ideas
- Provide context for future development work
- Maintain organized backlog of polish items

## File Structure
Each component/page gets its own improvement file:
- `transcript-editor.md` - TranscriptEditor component
- `dashboard.md` - Main projects dashboard (VideoEditor.tsx)
- `project-creation.md` - New project wizard
- etc.

## Issue Priority Levels
- ðŸ”¶ **Minor Issues** - Low impact, non-blocking
- ðŸš€ **Enhancements** - Future feature ideas
- ðŸ”§ **Technical Debt** - Code quality improvements
- ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX** - Design and usability improvements

## Usage
When working on a component and discovering minor issues or improvement opportunities:
1. Add them to the relevant improvement file
2. Include impact assessment and technical context
3. Reference specific file locations and line numbers
4. Keep focus on shipping functional features first

This system helps maintain development velocity while not losing track of quality improvements.
