  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 5,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A gritty urban street at night, illuminated by flickering streetlights casting harsh shadows. A young man stands center-frame, dressed in casual streetwear, his face partially obscured by a hoodie, exuding a mix of frustration and anxiety. Behind him, a chain-link fence looms, symbolizing entrapment, with a dimly lit 'JAIL' sign visible in the background. The ground is littered with crumpled bills and fast-food wrappers, emphasizing financial struggles. Close-up shots of his clenched fists and a frustrated glance toward the camera convey tension. The scene is shot in a low-angle, wide shot to emphasize vulnerability and the oppressive environment. Subtle motion blur adds dynamism, as if the world is moving too fast for him to keep up.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Cinematic realism with a raw, unfiltered aesthetic. Use shallow depth of field to focus on the protagonist while blurring the background. Incorporate handheld camera techniques for a sense of immediacy and unease. Add a slight vignette to draw attention to the central figure.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid overly bright or cheerful lighting, clean or polished environments, unrealistic or fantastical elements, and excessive digital effects that detract from the raw, gritty tone.\",\n  \"setting\": \"A desolate urban street at night, surrounded by graffiti-covered walls and a chain-link fence, with a 'JAIL' sign faintly visible in the background.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Wide shot with a low-angle perspective, combined with close-ups of the protagonist's hands and face.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Tense, anxious, and brooding, with a sense of entrapment and frustration.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dominantly dark tones\u2014deep blues, grays, and blacks\u2014with subtle pops of warm orange from the streetlights and cold green from the 'JAIL' sign. High contrast to emphasize shadows and mood.\"\n}\n```",
