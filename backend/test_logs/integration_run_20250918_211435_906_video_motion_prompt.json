  "response": "The artist stands confidently in a gritty urban alley, surrounded by graffiti-covered walls and dim streetlights. He slowly raises his hand, miming a gun gesture, as the camera zooms in on his intense expression. The background flickers with shadows of figures moving quickly across the alley, creating a tense atmosphere. The camera tilts slightly upward, emphasizing the artist's dominant stance, while the environment pulses with a rhythmic, low-frequency vibration, matching the song's intense and confident mood.",
