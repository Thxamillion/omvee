  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 4,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A chilling, ultra-detailed close-up of a shadowy figure in a dimly lit gym, their face obscured but their muscular frame glistening with sweat under a single, harsh overhead light. The figure's hands are outstretched, gripping a grotesque, semi-transparent layer of skin like a trophy, veins and sinew subtly visible. The background is a blur of rusted weights and chains, with a faint reflection of the figure in a cracked mirror. The lighting is high-contrast, with deep shadows and a cold, sickly green tint to emphasize the horror. The camera angle is slightly low, looking up at the figure to amplify their dominance and menace. The mood is visceral and unsettling, with a sense of raw violence barely contained.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Cinematic horror aesthetic with influences from 'Sin City' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Use chiaroscuro lighting for dramatic contrast, and a handheld camera effect for raw intensity. The texture should feel gritty and tactile, with hyper-realistic details on the skin and environment.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid bright colors, soft lighting, or any sense of warmth. Do not show the figure's full face\u2014keep it mysterious. No excessive gore; the horror should be implied, not explicit. Avoid clean or modern environments; this is a derelict, oppressive space.\",\n  \"setting\": \"A decaying, abandoned gym with broken equipment, peeling paint, and a thick layer of dust. The air feels heavy, and the only light comes from a flickering overhead bulb.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Extreme close-up with a slight Dutch angle to create unease. The focus is razor-sharp on the skin in the figure's hands, with the background slightly blurred but still detailed.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Unhinged, predatory, and claustrophobic. The viewer should feel a sense of dread and inevitability, as if the figure is seconds from striking.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dominant sickly green and desaturated browns, with stark black shadows and muted red accents (like rust or dried blood). The skin has a pale, yellowish hue, almost cadaverous.\"\n}\n```",
