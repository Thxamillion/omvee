  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 1,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A gritty, urban alleyway at night, dimly lit by flickering streetlights casting long shadows. In the foreground, a young man dressed in a hoodie and jeans stands confidently, holding a gleaming, custom-crafted steel weapon, its surface reflecting the cold, harsh light. Behind him, a row of shadowy figures is lined up against a graffiti-covered brick wall, their faces obscured, creating a sense of tension and foreboding. The camera captures a low-angle shot, emphasizing the protagonist's dominance and the looming threat of violence. Smoke drifts through the air, adding a chaotic, cinematic texture. The scene exudes raw intensity, with every detail sharp and vivid, from the textures of the wall to the glint of the steel weapon.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Cinematic, high-contrast lighting with a focus on shadows and reflections. The composition should be dynamic, with a strong leading line created by the row of figures. The shot should feel immersive, as if the viewer is standing in the alley, experiencing the tension firsthand.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid overly bright or cheerful lighting, overly polished or clean environments, and any elements that soften the gritty, raw emotion of the scene. Do not include any characters or objects that distract from the central focus on the protagonist and the lined-up figures.\",\n  \"setting\": \"A narrow, urban alleyway at night, with graffiti-covered brick walls, cracked pavement, and a sense of urban decay. The environment should feel suffocating and tense, reflecting the lyrical theme of violence.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Low-angle wide shot, capturing the protagonist in the foreground and the lined-up figures in the background, with the alley stretching out behind them. The angle emphasizes the protagonist's dominance and the scale of the threat.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Intense, foreboding, and raw, with a palpable sense of danger and tension. The scene should feel like a moment frozen in time, right before a violent confrontation.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dominantly cool tones\u2014deep blues, grays, and blacks\u2014with sharp accents of metallic silver from the weapon and warm highlights from the flickering streetlights. The contrast between the cold environment and the warm glints of light enhances the emotional intensity.\"\n}\n```",
