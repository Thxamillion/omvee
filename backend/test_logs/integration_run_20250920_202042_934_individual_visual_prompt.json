  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 3,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A high-intensity, cinematic close-up of a blood-splattered steering wheel, with a woman\u2019s hands gripping it tightly, her knuckles white from the strain. The camera is positioned low, looking up at the steering wheel to emphasize its dominance and the claustrophobic tension. Blood drips down the wheel and pools on the dashboard, illuminated by the harsh, flickering red and blue light of police sirens reflecting through the cracked windshield. The woman\u2019s face is partially visible in the rearview mirror, her expression a mix of terror and desperation, with streaks of sweat and tears glistening under the chaotic lighting. The background is blurred but reveals the distorted shapes of a chaotic car crash scene. The overall composition is tight and visceral, focusing on the raw emotion and violence described in the lyrics.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Gritty, high-contrast cinematography with a focus on dramatic lighting and raw, unfiltered emotion. The style should evoke a sense of urgency and horror, with a handheld camera effect to enhance the chaos. Use shallow depth of field to keep the focus on the steering wheel and the woman\u2019s hands.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid overly clean or polished visuals, bright or cheerful lighting, or anything that diminishes the intensity and grittiness of the scene. Do not include unnecessary elements that distract from the steering wheel and the woman\u2019s hands.\",\n  \"setting\": \"Inside a wrecked car at night, surrounded by the aftermath of a violent crash. The environment is chaotic, with shattered glass, twisted metal, and the flashing lights of emergency vehicles.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Close-up, low-angle shot focusing on the steering wheel and hands, with a shallow depth of field to blur the background while keeping the subject in sharp focus.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Tense, violent, and desperate, with an overwhelming sense of horror and urgency.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dark, desaturated tones dominated by black, red, and blue, with harsh contrasts between the cold blue of the sirens and the warm red of the blood. The overall palette should feel oppressive and intense.\"\n}\n```",
