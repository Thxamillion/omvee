  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 1,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A gritty, cinematic shot of a dimly lit urban alley at dusk, with a line of shadowy figures standing against a graffiti-covered brick wall, their silhouettes sharp and menacing. The foreground features a young man, the protagonist, holding a steel weapon (a wrench or pipe) with a determined, intense expression, his face partially illuminated by the warm glow of a streetlamp. The alley is wet from recent rain, reflecting the orange and yellow hues of the light, creating a stark contrast with the cool, dark tones of the background. Smoke drifts subtly in the air, adding depth and atmosphere. The composition is tight, focusing on the protagonist and the line of figures, with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the tension. The camera angle is low, looking slightly up at the protagonist, enhancing his dominance and the raw energy of the scene.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Cinematic realism with a focus on dramatic lighting and high contrast. The aesthetic should evoke a raw, unfiltered street vibe, with sharp details in the textures of the wall, the weapon, and the protagonist's clothing. The shot should feel dynamic, as if it\u2019s a still from an action-packed music video.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid overly bright or clean environments, overly polished textures, or anything that softens the gritty, raw mood. Do not include excessive clutter or distractions in the background. Ensure the focus remains on the protagonist and the line of figures.\",\n  \"setting\": \"A narrow, urban alley in a ghetto neighborhood, with graffiti-covered walls, broken pavement, and a single flickering streetlamp. The environment should feel tense and dangerous.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Low-angle close-up with a shallow depth of field, capturing the protagonist in the foreground and the line of figures in the background.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Intense, aggressive, and raw, with a sense of danger and dominance. The scene should feel like a moment of confrontation, charged with energy and tension.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dominant cool tones (dark blues and greys) for the shadows and background, contrasted with warm, saturated tones (orange and yellow) from the streetlamp. The reflections on the wet ground should enhance the contrast, adding visual depth and drama.\"\n}\n```",
