  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"scene_id\": 2,\n  \"image_prompt\": \"A gritty urban alley at night, illuminated by flickering orange streetlights with harsh shadows. A young man lies motionless on the ground, his head partially obscured by a pool of dark blood, creating a stark contrast against the cracked asphalt. A shadowy figure stands in the background, partially hidden in the darkness, holding a drill as if witnessing the aftermath. The camera focuses on the victim\u2019s wide, lifeless eyes, frozen in shock, while the foreground blurs slightly to emphasize depth. Smoke lingers in the air, adding a sense of chaos and danger. Include subtle motion blur to convey tension and urgency.\",\n  \"style_notes\": \"Cinematic hyper-realism with a raw, unfiltered aesthetic. Use a high-contrast lighting setup to amplify the drama, with chiaroscuro effects to highlight key elements like the victim\u2019s face and the drill. The composition should feel claustrophobic, with tight framing to heighten the intensity.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"Avoid bright, cheerful colors or overly clean environments. Do not include any elements that soften the scene\u2019s brutality, such as flowers or calming imagery. Ensure the drill is not cartoonish or unrealistic.\",\n  \"setting\": \"A dimly lit, narrow alleyway in a decaying urban neighborhood, littered with trash and graffiti. The walls are stained, and the ground is wet from recent rain, reflecting the orange glow of the streetlights.\",\n  \"shot_type\": \"Close-up shot of the victim\u2019s face, slightly tilted to create unease, with a shallow depth of field to blur the background. The camera angle is low, emphasizing the vulnerability of the victim and the dominance of the shadowy figure.\",\n  \"mood\": \"Tense, grim, and haunting. The scene should evoke a sense of dread and helplessness, with an undercurrent of raw emotion and trauma.\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"Dominant dark tones of black, deep gray, and blood red, accented by the harsh orange of the streetlights. Subtle hints of blue in the shadows to add coldness and detachment.\"\n}\n```",
