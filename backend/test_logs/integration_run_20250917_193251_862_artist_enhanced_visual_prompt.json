The alley is lined with graffiti-covered walls and chain-link fences, with faint smoke rising in the background. The camera angle is a dynamic low-angle shot, emphasizing his dominance and the raw energy of the lyrics. The lighting is dramatic, with stark contrasts between shadows and highlights, creating a moody, intense atmosphere.
